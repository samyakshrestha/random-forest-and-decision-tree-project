# random-forest-and-decision-tree-project

This project explores lending data from LendingClub.com to predict whether borrowers fully repaid their loans. I performed basic EDA and compared the performance of Decision Trees and Random Forests.

## Files in Repository
- **notebook.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook with analysis and model implementation.
- **dataset.csv**: LendingClub dataset used for the project.

## Objective
To analyze the dataset and evaluate the predictive performance of Decision Trees vs Random Forests.

## Credits
Based on the **"Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp"** by Jose Portilla on Udemy.
